# Kovcheg

Kovcheg is a greenfield web/PWA messenger platform. This repository contains only public application code and the technical files required to build and verify it.

The current branch establishes the Alpha-0 monorepo foundation. It deliberately contains no product authentication, database schema, messaging behavior, realtime integration, email delivery, functional PWA interface, deployment, or private product material.

## Toolchain

- Node.js `24.19.0` LTS is pinned as the production-oriented runtime line.
- pnpm `11.22.0` is pinned for deterministic workspace installs.
- TypeScript is strict across every workspace.

Use Corepack to activate the repository package manager, then install and verify the workspace:

```sh
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.22.0 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

## Repository structure

```text
apps/
  web/       Next.js web application entry point
  api/       NestJS browser-facing API entry point
  auth/      NestJS authentication service entry point
  worker/    NestJS background worker entry point
packages/
  contracts/ Shared public TypeScript contracts
  config/    Shared non-secret configuration primitives
infra/       Infrastructure placeholders and public operational notes
```

These directories are intentionally minimal. Service connections, Docker topology, persistence, API contracts, and product behavior are added in later reviewed changes.
